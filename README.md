## Steps I followed
Since this was a seconadry midterm project, took the easy way out as stated on brightspace and used the build-in example.

## Problems
Couldn't properly upload it to my esp32-cam but that was fixed easily with a reset, and finding the proper timezone. Pretty cool what you can do with this, seems like a useful thing to have on the ESP32-cam.
